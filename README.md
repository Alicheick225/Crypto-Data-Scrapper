# Crypto-Data-Scrapper
This project is about a Web Data scrapper that i built with Python. 

The bot has to scrap data like Coin Names, Prices, Marketcaps, Volumes,... from CoinMarketcap and add it in a Csv file, then send it to a specified email Adress with the exact Data date.

For a first version, i just focus on five cryptos, but the principle remains the same
